## What is DRM

### Seanpm2001 / unknown definition

I am not sure whether my definition has already been said, but I feel it works best: DRM (Digital Restrictive Measures) I feel that the FSFs definition of "Digital Restrictions Management" doesn't work, as with DRM, you are not the one managing the DRM, the DRM is managing you. I agree with all other points made, just not this wording.

### [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_rights_management&oldid=1099478614)

DRM is the management of legal access to digital content. Various tools or technological protection measures (TPM) such as access control technologies can restrict the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies govern the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems that enforce these policies within devices.

Laws in many countries criminalize the circumvention of DRM, communication about such circumvention, and the creation and distribution of tools used for such circumvention.

### Free Software Foundation (FSF) / Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF) definition

DRM: Digital Restrictions Management

### General public definition

DRM: Digital Rights Management

### Problems with DRM

I have written multiple articles on the problems of DRM, and you can find many more online. I made this repository to link to them and platform them:

- [Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM) - An article on why Googles WideVine DRM should not be used. 
- [DRM (current article)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DRM/)
- ["Awesome" DRM](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Awesome-DRM/) - A list of DRM schemes, and why they are bad. Note that DRM is never awesome, and does not belong in an actual awesome list.

#### Bad for the environment

Due to unnecessary resource consumption and battery drain caused by DRM, DRM is bad for the environment. In some cases, it can be worse than cryptominers.

#### Proprietary

All DRM is proprietary. Proprietary software (closed source software) is in and of itself [malware](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/), and you cannot trust what DRM does, as there is no way to verify what it is doing exactly.
